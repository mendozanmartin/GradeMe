# GradeMe
An app created for slackers, designed by slackers. This app is meant to be so easy to use that even a 4 year can get around, not that they even have GPAs.

## Short description
We are developing a mobile application that will allow you to store all of your GPAs conveniently. This app will include:
* How much you need to pass course calculator
* Best mark you can achieve in course calculator
* GPA vs. time visualizer
* GPA conversions
* Mark you need to achieve a certain grade
* We're still thinking of more...
